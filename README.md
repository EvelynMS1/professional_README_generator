The  Additionally, using the node package which allows the use of terminal plus using the inquirer methoinquirer method making it possible for the use of methods such as fs and prompt to be used in program. The use of fs which creates a new file in which a literal can be used to implement users respond for readme by taking object variables from the object that was returned by the prompt method.
