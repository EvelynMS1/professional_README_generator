## Description
 The motivation in creating this program was to impplement recently learned knowledge of node. this project so that I could implement the use of the inquirer method and prompt method from the node package. By creating this project, it solves the problem of having to create a readme file from scratch each time that a new repository is created. Therefore, in this case a readme file is automatically created by utilizing the provided node method of prompts that presents user with prompts that are then answered by user within the terminal, implementing users’ response into a new file. Thus reducing the amount of time it takes to create a readme file from scratch.  I learned how to structure code in a format that would be more concise and easier to read such as creating separate sections that contain functions that handle different tasks. Additionally, using the node package which allows the use of terminal plus using the inquirer method and the fs method that is provided by node. The inquirer method making it possible for the use of methods such as fs and prompt to be used in program. The use of fs which creates a new file in which a literal can be used to implement users respond for readme by taking object variables from the object that was returned by the prompt method.
